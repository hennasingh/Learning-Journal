                        <h1>My frontend developer bootcamp journey.</h1>
                        <p>
                            I love to write my learnings and share it with the community. I started with Frontend 
                            Developer Career Path from scrimba on Aug 22, 2023 and I have penned down my learnings since. At the end of Oct, I 
                            made a big move to join the bootcamp, to get more expert reviews for my projects and meet like-minded peers.

                        <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4>
                        <p>
                            Commitment is not easy. It requires discipline and consistency. It also has to be 
                            backed by a desire to achieve. It was initially difficult to set a routine but I am now determined to switch to
                            development and share my knowledge via writing or speaking with the world. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>How I got started</h4>
                        <p>
                            Writing has always been my passion. I believe I can explain concepts to others very clearly. Writing what I am learning
                            also helps me reflect on what I learned and refer them back anytime I need to look at a concept.
