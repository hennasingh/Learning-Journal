                <h1>My frontend developer bootcamp journey</h1>
                <p>
                    I started the frontend developer career path on Scrimba on Aug 22. I've made the 
                    big jump over to the bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo projects and study 
                    along with my peers on group projects. I planned 100 days initially to finish it. Let's see 
                    how long I take to finish.
                </p>

                <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4>
                <p>
                    Commitment is not easy. It requires discipline and consistency. It also has to be 
                    backed by a desire to achieve. It was initially difficult to set a routine but I am now determined to switch to
                    development and share my knowledge via writing or speaking with the world. 
                </p>
                <h4>How I got started</h4>
                <p>
                    Writing has always been my passion. I believe I can explain concepts to others very clearly. Writing what I am learning
                    also helps me reflect on what I learned and refer them back anytime I need to look at a concept.  
                </p>
